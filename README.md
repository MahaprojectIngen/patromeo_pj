all about spring

this is a project based upon spring mvc framework,get inspired by openclassroom practical work,
to running this project for an existing ide like IntelliJ IDEA, you just need to clone the git project address into your repository by command line or download directly from here,and you just need to extract it into your workspace and follow the step to import project that your favorite ide require (you could make apache tomcat to be embedded from the pom.xml)
